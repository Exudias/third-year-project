# Lighter Than Time
A complete vertical slice of a 2D puzzle-platformer game, made from scratch with the Unity game engine.

The game has a unique mechanic: as a light spirit, you are able to possess light bulbs and use them as temporary bodies. This allows you to go from vessel to vessel, to reach otherwise inaccessible areas. Combining the grounded but stable light bulb form and the erratic flying form of the light spirit is the main challenge of the game.
